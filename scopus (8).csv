However, the effect of regional unbalanced carbon tax is still unknown. In this study, an improved two-region computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is developed to fill this research gap with Liaoning Province and the rest of China (ROC) as the study area. Business as usual (BaU) and nine carbon tax scenarios are designed. Results show that in 2030, the highest carbon tax of 221 USD/ton-CO2 in taxC4P8 scenario in Liaoning province will lead to carbon reduction of 44.92% with the cost of 5.54% Gross Domestic Product (GDP) loss. Price effect and scale effect are the two mechanisms that affect the changes in GDP, industrial output and CO2 emissions. Industrial structure, energy consumption and carbon intensity of Liaoning are overwhelmingly affected by the price effect. Most less energy-intensive industries belong to the winner industries due to the higher influence of domestic market. By contrast, loser industries, including most of the energy-intensive industries, are mainly affected by the changes of provincial and international markets. ROC region is mainly affected by the price effect. Suggestions about preferential developmental industries are offered to balance the environmental and economic concerns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Computable general equilibrium model; Liaoning in China; Nationally determined contributions (NDCs)","Åhman, M., Nilsson, L.J., Johansson, B., Global climate policy and deep decarbonization of energy-intensive industries (2016) Clim.

Accordingly, we measured airlines sales and CO2 emission reductions to evaluate economic efficiency and environmental effectiveness, respectively, for various policies. The results show that the average carbon emission reduction rates of four policies compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario between 2015 and 2030 are 4.00% (Voluntary Agreement), 7.25% (Emission Trading System or ETS-30,000), 8.33% (Carbon Tax or CT-37,500), and 8.48% (Emission Charge System or EC-30,000). The average rate of decrease in airline sales compared to BAU for the ETS policy is 0.1% at 2030. Our results show that the ETS approach is the most efficient of all the analyzed CO2 reduction policies in economic terms, while the EC approach is the best policy to reduce GHG emissions. This study provides a foundation for devising effective response measures pertaining to GHG reduction and supports decision making on carbon tax and carbon credit pricing.. © 2016 by the authors.","Carbon tax; Emission Trading System; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction; International aviation; System dynamics","Hong, S., Chung, Y., Kim, J., Chun, D., Analysis on the level of contribution to the national greenhouse gas reduction target in Korean transportation sector using LEAP model (2016) Renew.

Lately, the business and labour organisations have raised concerns that the government’s intention to implement the carbon tax policy will affect the food supply, subsequently exacerbating the unemployment and food insecurity in the country. Carbon tax is one of the policy tools to be implemented in order to reduce the growing greenhouse gas emissions thus helping the government meets its Paris Agreement commitments. South Africa’s National Treasury released a second draft of the carbon tax bill in 2017, which takes into account the concerns raised by different organisations. In this paper, we evaluate the potential impact of the carbon tax policy on agriculture, food and other sectors using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. The results show that the carbon tax is an effective policy tool to mitigate emissions, as they decline by 33% relative to the baseline by 2035. This also leads to a welfare loss of R98.326 billion as the country transforms into a green economy. The carbon-intensive sectors like transport, steel and coal-generated electricity experiences significant output decline. However, the agriculture and food sectors show improvements in terms of jobs and production when the carbon tax is implemented. The positive effects on these two sectors are greatly reduced if tax exemptions provided to the agricultural sector are removed and the tax revenue is not recycled in the form of production subsidy to industries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Carbon tax; CGE","Adams, P.D., Dixon, J., Giesecke, J., Horridge, J.M., (2014) MONASH multi-regional forecasting model, , Centre of Policy Studies, Melbourne; Alton, T., Arndt, C., Davies, R., Hartley, F., Mekrelov, K., Thurlow, J., Ubogu, D., Introducing carbon taxes in South Africa (2014) Appl Energy, 116, pp. 344-354; Armington, P.S., (1969) A theory of demand for products distinguished by place of production, pp. 159-178. , Int Monet Fund Staff Pap, XVI; Arndt, C., Davies, R., Makrelov, K., Thurlow, J., Measuring the carbon intensity of the South African economy (2013) S Afr J Econ, 81 (3), pp. 393-415; Bohlmann, H.R., Van Heerden, J.H., Dixon, P.B., Rimmer, M.T., The impact of the 2014 platinum mining strike in South Africa: an economy-wide analysis (2015) Econ Modell, 51, pp. 403-411; Burniaux, J.M., Truong, T., (2002) GTAP-E: An energy-environmental version of the GTAP model, , GTAP Technical Paper No. 16; (2017) South Africa’s Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC, , www.dea.gov.za, Accessed 7 July 2017; Devarajan, S., Go, D.S., Robinson, S., Thierfelder, K., Tax policy to reduce carbon emissions in a distorted economy: illustration from a South African CGE model (2011) BE J Econ Anal Policy, 11 (1), pp. 1-24; Dixon, P.B., Rimmer, M.T., (2002) Dynamic General Equilibrium Modelling for forecasting and policy: a practical guide and documentation of Monash, , Elsevier, Amsterdam; Dixon, P.B., Koopman, R.B., Rimmer, M.T., The MONASH style of CGE modeling (2013) Handbook of computable general equilibrium modeling, , Dixon PB, Jorgenson DW, (eds), North-Holland, Amsterdam; Garnett, T., Where are the best opportunities for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the food system (including the food chain)?

Digitalization complicates taxation due to decreasing physical presence and increasing international mobility of tax bases. Since labor is internationally less mobile, taxes on labor income will remain an integral part of both countries’ tax systems. This is also true for the value added tax that taxes local consumption, which is internationally hardly mobile. In contrast, taxes on mobile corporate profits will tend to lose importance as long as tax competition is not effectively curbed by international co-operation. Therefore, taxation of corporate profits should be oriented to the individual final beneficial owners who tend to be largely immobile. Due to high compliance costs and possibilities for international tax avoidance, the wealth tax is inappropriate to tackle economic inequality. The estate and gift tax, without an exemption for business property, is better suited to reduce inequality. If taxation should serve as a means against climate change, a global uniform tax on CO2 is necessary. Its level should correspond to the envisaged emissions reduction. Since environmental taxes cannot be avoided in the short and medium term, the resulting distribution effects have to be considered. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon tax; Corporate taxation; Digitalization; Economic inequality; International tax base mobility","Aigner, D., Bräumann, P., Kofler, G., Tumpel, M., Digitale Leistungen ohne Geldzahlung im Internet, Unterliegen Gratis-Dienste und Apps der Umsatzsteuer?

We extend the existing literature by employing an open economy model to evaluate three environmental policy instruments: cap-and-trade, pollution taxes, and an emissions intensity standard in the face of two types of exogenous shocks. We calibrate the model to Canadian data and simulate productivity and import price shocks. We evaluate the evolution of key macroeconomic variables, including the trade balance in response to the shocks under each policy instrument. Our findings for the evolution of output and emissions under a productivity shock are consistent with previous closed economy models. Our open economy framework allows us to find that a cap-and-trade policy dampens the international trade effects of the business cycle relative to an emissions tax or intensity standard. Under an import shock, pollution taxes and intensity targets are as effective as cap-and-trade policies in reducing variance in consumption and employment. The cap-and-trade policy limits the intensity of the import competition shock suggesting that particular policy instrument might serve as a barrier to trade. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Business cycles; Environmental policy; Import competition; Macroeconomic dynamics; Open economy","Adjemian, S., Bastani, H., Juillard, M., Mihoubi, F., Perendia, G., Ratto, M., Villemot, S., (2011) Dynare: Reference manual.

Can governments of coal-producing countries help facilitate this transition and benefit from it? This paper analyses the case for coal taxes as supply-side climate policy implemented by large coal exporting countries. Coal taxes can reduce global carbon dioxide emissions and benefit coal-rich countries through improved terms-of-trade and tax revenue. We employ a multi-period equilibrium model of the international steam coal market to study a tax on steam coal levied by Australia alone, by a coalition of major exporting countries, by all exporters, and by all producers. A unilateral export tax has little impact on global emissions and global coal prices as other countries compensate for reduced export volumes from the taxing country. By contrast, a tax jointly levied by a coalition of major coal exporters would significantly reduce global emissions from steam coal and leave them with a net sector level welfare gain, approximated by the sum of producer surplus, consumer surplus, and tax revenue. Production taxes consistently yield higher tax revenues and have greater effects on global coal consumption with smaller rates of carbon leakages. Questions remain whether coal taxes by major suppliers would be politically feasible, even if they could yield economic benefits. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",,"Bard, J.F., Plummer, J., Sourie, J.C., A bilevel programming approach to determining tax credits for biofuel production (2000) Eur J Oper Res, 120 (1), pp. 30-46; Böhringer, C., Rosendahl, K.E., Schneider, J., Unilateral climate policy: can OPEC resolve the leakage problem?

The subject of the study is the structure and dynamics of excise duty revenues in Russia by type of energy product, depending on the volume of consumption and tax rates. A conclusion is drawn that the mechanism of taxing motor fuel is based on the volume of the consumed resources and does not take into account their environmental damage and energy content. The author argues that tax rates on motor fuel need to take into account its energy efficiency characteristics and the level of carbon dioxide emissions. The author concludes that by implementing the proposed changes it would be possible to have a considerable fiscal effect in terms of public revenue and to tackle the existing distortions the existing distortions for two competing sources of energy (petrol versus diesel fuel). The new approach would also encourage a transition to environmentally friendly types of fuel, the adoption of new technologies in car making and a reduction in pollutant emissions.

Between these two market-based approaches, however, carbon taxes offer significant advantages, including transparency and predictability of costs, ease of implementation, and application to small and large sources alike. This article thus seeks to inform our understanding of the conditions under which carbon taxes are politically viable by comparing the experience of four jurisdictions: Finland and Denmark, which adopted carbon taxes; Germany, which adopted a related energy tax; and Canada, which rejected a carbon tax. The cases highlight the role of policy entrepreneurs in advancing academic theories about environmental taxation. However, the impact of those ideas was conditional on voters' attention to either the environmental or economic benefits of carbon taxes. Even then, business tended to be more attentive, thus winning tax concessions relative to households. Proportional electoral systems tended to facilitate adoption of carbon taxes, whereas international institutions had mixed effects, in some cases advancing harmonization and in others undermining resolve for unilateral taxation.

There is no mechanism to force a country to comply with its own nationally determined contributions. This bottom-up approach builds on unilateral actions and yields a kind of carbon pricing, which is not necessarily identical across countries. As a consequence, these nationally determined climate policies have drawbacks in terms of carbon leakage and loss of competitiveness for firms producing in high carbon price countries. To reduce these negative effects, border adjustments (BAs) may be appropriate subsequent to more stringent environmental regulation. We model a three-stage game involving carbon price competition in the first stage, the introduction of BAs in the second stage and oligopolistic competition between firms in the third stage. Strategic trade theory suggests that the qualitative results about the optimal BA policy may vary with the underlying type of competition, namely Bertrand and Cournot competition. However, our results are similar for both types of competition. We conclude that BAs are suitable for supporting a more stringent environmental policy. Moreover, we find that anticipation of the implementation of BAs in the second stage yields higher average carbon prices in the first stage since high carbon price countries increase their carbon prices whereas the other countries partially offset. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Border adjustment; Carbon pricing; Environmental tax competition; International trade; Oligopolistic competition; Unilateral climate policy","Anoulies, L., The strategic and effective dimensions of the border tax adjustment (2015) J Public Econ Theory, 17 (6), pp. 824-847; Barrett, S., Strategic environmental policy and international trade (1994) J Public Econ, 54, pp. 325-338; Böhringer, C., Fischer, C., Rosendahl, K.E., The global effects of subglobal climate policies (2010) B.E.

In addition to the conventional marginal abatement cost curve, we present a pair of complementary marginal abatement cost curves which highlight the impact CO 2 taxation has on economic performance and public debt and are therefore directly relevant to the terms of the policy debate. These marginal abatement cost curves provide an effective tool for understanding the rate at which the environmental effectiveness, economic costs, and budgetary effects change with the tax level. Our results indicate that CO 2 taxes can be an important policy instrument for reducing emissions and promoting fiscal consolidation, although this will come at a cost in terms of economic performance. Simulation results suggest that a tax of 17.00 Euros per tCO 2 can satisfy existing climate policy targets. The tax revenue effects, together with reductions in public spending, yield a 4.8 % reduction in public debt. These desirable outcomes come at the cost of a 1.3 % reduction in GDP over the long term. Our analysis highlights that limiting public consumption expenditures can contribute to larger reductions in public debt, albeit at a marginally greater cost to economic activity. In turn, reducing public investment, although effective in reducing public debt, produces a much larger negative economic impact. This evokes an important trade-off, particularly pronounced in the present debates regarding austerity measures in the EU, between fiscal consolidation efforts and efforts to promote convergence to EU standards of living. These results further highlight that modeling assumptions with respect to public spending decision are not innocuous. An exogenous trajectory for public spending suggests substantially smaller GDP effects and substantially larger public debt effects for any given emissions target. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon taxation; Dynamic general equilibrium; Endogenous growth; Marginal abatement costs","Barker, T., Baylis, S., Madsen, P., A UK carbon/energy tax: the macroeconomics effects (1993) Energy Policy, 21 (3), pp. 296-308; Barker, T.M., Qureshi, K.J., The costs of greenhouse gas mitigation with induced technological change: a meta-analysis of estimates in the literature. 4CMR (2006) Cambridge Centre for Climate Change Mitigation Research, , University of Cambridge, Cambridge; Bovenburg, A.L., de Mooij, R., Environmental tax reform and endogenous growth (1997) J Public Econ, 63, pp. 207-237; Carbone, J., Morgenstern, R., Williams, I.I.I.R., Burtraw, D., Deficit reduction and carbon taxes: budgetary, economic and distributional impacts.

Most of the proposed regimes are based on an allocation of emissions rights that is perceived as fair. Yet, there are also arguments to focus more on the actual welfare implications of different regimes and to focus on a ‘fair’ distribution of resulting costs. In this article, the computable general equilibrium model DART is used to analyse the driving forces of welfare implications in different scenarios in line with the 2 °C target. These include two regimes that are often presumed to be ‘fair’, namely a harmonized international carbon tax and a cap and trade system based on the convergence of per capita emissions rights, and also an ‘equal loss’ scenario where welfare losses relative to a business-as-usual scenario are equal for all major world regions. The main finding is that indirect energy market effects are a major driver of welfare effects and that the ‘equal loss’ scenario would thus require large transfer payments to energy exporters to compensate for welfare losses from lower world energy demand and prices. Policy relevance A successful future climate regime requires ‘fair’ burden sharing. Many proposed regimes start from ethical considerations to derive an allocation of emissions reduction requirements or emissions allowances within an international emissions trading scheme. Yet, countries also consider the expected economic costs of a regime that are also driven by other factors besides allowance allocation. Indeed, in simplified lab experiments, successful groups are characterized by sharing costs proportional to wealth. This article shows that the major drivers of welfare effects are reduced demand for fossil energy and reduced fossil fuel prices, which implies that (1) what is often presumed to be a fair allocation of emissions allowances within an international emissions trading scheme leads to a very uneven distribution of economic costs and (2) aiming for equal relative losses for all regions requires large compensation to fossil fuel exporters, as argued, for example, by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","burden sharing; emissions trading; energy markets; international climate regime; outcome-based allocation; taxes","Boeters, S., Optimally differentiated carbon prices for unilateral climate policy (2014) Energy Economics, 45, pp. 304-312; Böhringer, C., Lange, A., Rutherford, T.F., Optimal emission pricing in the presence of international spillovers: Decomposing leakage and terms-of-trade motives (2014) Journal of Public Economics, 110, pp. 101-111; Böhringer, C., Rutherford, T.F., Carbon abatement and international spillovers: A decomposition of general equilibrium effects (2002) Environmental and Resource Economics, 22, pp. 391-417; Den Elzen, M., Lucas, P., The FAIR model: A tool to analyse environmental and costs implications of regimes of future commitments (2005) Environmental Modeling and Assessment, 10, pp. 115-134; Depledge, J., Striving for No: Saudi Arabia in the climate change regime (2008) Global Environmental Politics, 8 (4), pp. 9-35; De Vries, B.J., van Vuuren, D., den Elzen, M., Janssen, M., (2001), The targets image energy regional (TIMER) model (Technical Documentation, Report 461502024 2001).

The energy-economy-environment (E3) IMACLIM-R model is used to provide a detailed representation of passenger and freight transportation. Unlike many of the E3 models used to simulate mitigation options, IMACLIM-R represents both the technological and behavioural determinants of mobility. By comparing business-as-usual, carbon price only, and carbon price combined with transport policy scenarios, it is demonstrated that the measures that foster a modal shift towards low-carbon modes and a decoupling of mobility needs from economic activity significantly modify the sectoral distribution of mitigation efforts and reduce the level of carbon tax necessary to reach a given climate target relative to a 'carbon price only' policy. Policy relevance Curbing carbon emissions from transport activities is necessary in order to reach mitigation targets, but it poses a challenge for policy makers. The transport sector has two peculiarities: a weak ability to react to standard pricing measures (which encourages richer policy interventions) and a dependence on long-lived infrastructure (which imposes a delay between policy interventions and effective action). To address these problems, a framework is proposed for analysing the role of transport-specific measures adopted complementarily to carbon pricing in the context of international climate policies. Consideration is given to alternative approaches such as infrastructure measures designed to control mobility through less mobility-intensive denser agglomerations, investment reorientation towards public mode, and logistics reorganization towards less mobility-dependent production processes. Such measures can significantly reduce transport emissions in the long term and hence would moderate an increase in the carbon price and reduce its more important detrimental impacts on the economy. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","infrastructure; mitigation policy; spatial organization; transport","Åkerman, J., Höjer, M., How much transport can the climate stand? - Sweden on a sustainable path in 2050 (2006) Energy Policy, 34 (14), pp. 1944-1957. , doi:10.1016/j.enpol.2005.02.009; Allcott, H., (2010) Beliefs and consumer choice, , (Working Paper).

Consumption-based pricing of emissions-which could in practice be implemented with a full border tax adjustment (BTA)-has been forwarded as an option to increase the effectiveness of unilateral climate policy. This paper questions the economic rationale behind this approach, using a theoretical 2 × 2 trade model in which leakage occurs through terms-of-trade effects. We show analytically, first, that consumption-based pricing of emissions does not necessarily result in less leakage than production-based policies. Second, the sign of the optimal unilateral carbon tariff depends on the carbon-intensity differential between the foreign country's exporting and non-exporting sectors, and not on the differential between home's and foreign's exporting sectors, as implied by the full BTA approach. Third, based on empirical data for the year 2004, our model implies that full BTA applied by the European Union on e.g. imports from and exports to China would-by shifting China's production from the export sector with a relatively low carbon-intensity towards the more carbon-intensive non-export sector-actually increase leakage. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Border tax adjustment; Carbon tariff; Climate policy; Consumption-based emission policy; Leakage","Babiker, M.H., Rutherford, T.F., The economic effects of border measures in subglobal climate agreements (2005) Energy J, 26 (4), pp. 99-126; Barrett, S., Self-enforcing international environmental agreements (1994) Oxf Econ Pap, 46, pp. 878-894; Bhagwati, J., Mavroidis, P.C., Is action against US exports for failure to sign Kyoto Protocol WTO-legal?

Together with private travel, domestic energy reductions are one of the few ways that households can directly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. Although domestic energy costs form a minor part of average household expenditure, the unit costs for domestic electricity and natural gas vary by a factor of 4 and 5, respectively, among OECD countries, and per capita use is strongly influenced by these costs. Other influences on domestic energy use are household income, household size, residence type (apartment/flat vs. detached house), and regional climate. Numerous campaigns have been carried out in various countries to reduce household energy use. A large literature has analyzed both the results of these studies and the general psychology of pro-environmental behavior, yet the findings often seem to conflict with the national statistical data. The authors argue that the rising frequency of extreme weather events (especially heat waves, storms, and floods), together with sea level rises, is likely to be a key factors in getting both the public and policy makers to treat global climate change as a matter of urgency. Costs of domestic energy are likely to rise in the future, possibly because of carbon taxes. But such taxes will need to be supplemented by other policies that not only encourage the use of more efficient energy-consuming appliances but also unambiguously support energy and emission reductions in all sectors. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Australia; Barriers to conservation; Carbon taxes; Climate extremes; Conflicting policies; Domestic energy consumption; Ecological citizenship; Electricity use; Energy conservation context; Energy costs; Energy efficiency; Energy performance rating; Environmentally friendly modes; European union (EU); Extreme weather; Fossil fuel depletion; Fossil fuel reserves; Gross national income (GNI); Household expenditure; Household income; Household size; Income inequality; Information provision; Involuntary environmentalists; Japan; Moral licensing; National statistical data; Natural gas use; Organisation for economic co-operation and development (OECD); Personal carbon trading; Pro-environmental behavior; Refrigerators; Representative concentration pathway (RCP); Smart houses; Social context; Social cost of carbon; Social marketing; Social psychology; Space heating; Structure of domestic energy costs; Unintended consequences; United kingdom; United states; Urban density; Urban heat island","Ackerman, F., Stanton, E.A., (2012) Climate risks and carbon prices: Revising the social cost of carbon, , http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2012-10; Attari, S.Z., DeKay, M.L., Davidson, C.I., Public perceptions of energy consumption and savings (2010) Proc Natl Acad Sci, 107 (37), pp. 16054-16059; (2012) 2009-10 household expenditure survey: Summary of results, , ABS, Canberra, Cat No 6530; Bohr, J., Public views on the dangers and importance of climate change: Predicting climate change beliefs in the United States through income moderated by party identification (2014) Clim Chang.; Booth, C., A motivational turn for environmental ethics (2009) Ethics Environ, 14 (1), pp. 53-78; (2014) BP statistical review of world energy 2014, , BP, London; Cook, D., How smart is your home?

For this, we develop an Eaton–Kortum type general equilibrium model of international trade which includes an energy sector. We structurally estimate the key parameters of the model and calibrate it to the data on 31 OECD countries and the rest of the world in the year 2000. The model helps assessing the relative welfare effects under alternative environmental policies. We find that, when carbon spillover effects are absent, taxing energy resources as an input in energy production is preferable to taxing domestic energy production in terms of minimizing (Formula presented.) emissions. However, with negative externalities on foreign customers domestic energy output should be taxed to minimize world carbon emissions given a certain level of welfare change for all countries. © 2014, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon spillovers; Carbon taxes; Energy demand; General equilibrium; International trade","Acemoglu, D., Aghion, P., Bursztyn, L., Hemous, D., The environment and directed technical change (2012) Am Econ Rev, 102 (1), pp. 131-166; Ackerman, F., Stanton, E., Climate risks and carbon prices: revising the social cost of carbon.

Scientifically concluded, the anthropogenic GHG'S are contributing to Global warming. The resultant effect is 'Climate change' which is now perceived to be one of the global risk factors, the business faces. The Quantification &amp; Management of Climate related impacts on business, investments, reduction of risk / liability &amp; pursuit of opportunities, is therefore necessary. Along with risk, Carbon emissions (CO2) as a financial commodity currently represent a rapidly growing international market worth over $10 billion. Therefore, it uniquely positions CO2 to leverage opportunities in the carbon emissions trading as well. Oil &amp; Gas industry is one of major sources for GHG emissions. The O&amp;G activities involve burning, processing, flaring &amp; transporting fossil fuels which emit CO2. It is therefore, imperative that O&amp;G industry need adopt initiatives in mitigating GHG emissions, monitoring &amp; control. The Carbon Management is the key to mitigating CO2 emission. There is an increasing trend amongst oil companies to adopt Carbon Management practices. The challenges include GHG estimation, to internalize externalities, future allocations, caps, low carbon development abatement technologies &amp; the mitigation measures. Globally new developments include energy, fuel consumption &amp; the emissions taxes. There are National control of emission inventories &amp; the forecast, for national planning purposes. In this paper, development of GHG inventory (&amp; Prediction), GHG accounting system, GHG information system, climate protection policy, protocols, scientific assessments, sustainability reporting, purported benefits to stakeholders, Industry / business, new regulatory requirements, sustainability &amp; economic development, climate change &amp; carbon management opportunities available to the service providers, have been covered. Other issues associated with Climate change briefed are; Scientific complexity, Government policy, International debate and the Competitive pressure. Carbon Management is going to be a reality in near future for oil companies and the Global trend is in vogue. It is beneficial to adopt proactive approach to be a Competitive, Effective &amp; Credible Organization and realize first mover benefit besides fostering innovation &amp; technology development and influencing global financial systems.

The substance of the individual bills - rangingfrom levy impositions on greenhouse gas to fuel tax legislation - had ignited stormy public controversy. Advocates on both sides of the climate change debate emerged, as the Australian legislation proposed a carbon levy for the first time. The proposed legislation was acknowledged as globally significant, although similar environment policy had been enacted in Switzerland and Sweden. The department responsible for running the public consultations, the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency (DCCEE), was newly established as an agency in its own right in 2010, as part of 'Machinery of Government' changes: responsible for a broad portfolio of climate change policies and implementation, including community, household and business sector climate action, and a remit to contribute to a global climate change solution. Its role is educative as well as instrumental. DCCEE meets freedom of information legislation and transparency expectations, and supports public consultations through rich information provided in an ongoing context of lobbying and misinformation. Using public domain material, the paper assesses the management of the complex online consultation, beginning by contextualizing the international and local policy contexts. It notes significant characteristics in DCCEE's stewardship: achieving transparency and equity, and setting parameters for citizen input. It assesses why seemingly more conservative means were deployed to engage citizens in consultations over a multi-segmented and contentious piece of legislation, designed to effect radical social and economic change.","Climate change; Contentious issues; Green citizenship; Policy consultation; Transparency","Australian Livestock and Rural Transport Association (2011) Submission to Clean Energy Legislative Package Consultation, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/cleanenergy-legislative-package/public-submissions.aspx, [online]; Australian Industry Greenhouse Network (2011) Submission to Clean Energy Legislative Package Consultation, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/clean-energylegislative-package/public-submissions.aspx, [online]; Australian Policy Online (2011) Clean Energy Bill 2011 Exposure Draft, , http://apo.org.au/research/cleanenergy-bill-2011-exposure-draft, [online]; Australian Trucking Association (2011) Submission to Clean Energy Legislative Package Consultation, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/clean-energy-legislativepackage/public-submissions.aspx, [online]; Bureau of Meteorology (2011) Annual Climate Change Statement 2011, Commonwealth of Australia, , http://www.bom.gov.au/announcements/media_releases/climate/change/20120104.shtml, [online]; Clean Energy Future (2012) Commonwealth of Australia, , http://www.cleanenergyfuture.gov.au/cleanenergy-bills-receive-royal-assent/, [online]; Patrick, C., Green Citizenship and Education in Ecological Ethics: An Introduction (2011) Polity: Cambridge, pp. 159-83; Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency Commonwealth of Australia, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/default.aspx, [online]; Doecke, S., (2011) Submission to Clean Energy Bill Consultation, 18 August, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/clean-energy-legislativepackage/public-submissions.aspx, [online]; Early, S., Email submission to Greg Combet DCCEE (2011), http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/clean-energy-legislativepackage/public-submissions.aspx, 28 July [online]; (2012) Energy Rating Website, , http://www.energyrating.gov.au/, [online]; Garnaut, R., Garnaut Climate Change Review (2011), http://www.garnautreview.org.au/update-2011/garnaut-review-2011.html, [online]; Gordon, T., (2011) Submission to Clean Energy Legislative Package Consultation, 3 August, , http://www.climatechange.gov.au/government/submissions/closed-consultations/clean-energy-legislativepackage/public-submissions.aspx, [online]; Greening Australia (2011) Gondwana Link, , http://www.greeningaustralia.org.au/visionaryprojects/gondwana-link, [online]; (2012) Green Plumbers: Creating Sustainable Communities, , http://www.greenplumbers.com.au, [online]; Griffiths, M., Edemocracy design: Citizen consultation on contentious issues (2009) Prosser A. and P.

The use and adoption of reverse logistics has increased with the start of product recalls, but the rise of e-commerce and insight into the positive environmental impact has elevated the formal use and sophistication of reverse logistics. There are many environmental issues that may arise from the production and transportation of products. The focus of this study is to evaluate supply chain environmental implications presented in a reverse logistic setting. These environmental contributions come with associated costs that can no longer be ignored in the mathematical modeling of reverse logistics. The model developed in this paper considers energy used for manufacturing and remanufacturing as well as greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing, remanufacturing and transportation activities with emissions penalty tax as per The European Union Emissions Trading System. The objective of the model is to develop a total cost function that is minimized by determining the following: the manufacturing batch size per cycle, the number of manufacturing batches per cycle, the number of remanufacturing batches per cycle, and the number of times an item may be remanufactured. Numerical examples are provided. The results show that optimizing for financial costs and all the environmental costs collectively promotes less remanufacturing to protect the environment as opposed to just focusing on solid waste disposal, which has been the focus of previous 'traditional' reverse logistics models that consider remanufacturing. In addition, the results show the need to increase the recollection of available used products that can be remanufactured. The proposed model is seen as a preliminary step into developing an environmentally responsible reverse logistics inventory model. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Energy; Green supply chains; Greenhouse gas emissions; Remanufacturing; Reverse logistics","Bazan, E., Jaber, M.Y., Zanoni, S., Supply chain models with greenhouse gases emissions, energy usage and different coordination decisions (2015) Applied Mathematical Modelling, 39 (17), pp. 5131-5151; Bei, W., Linyan, S., A review of reverse logistics (2005) Applied Sciences, 7, pp. 16-29; Bishop, P.L., Pollution prevention: A new paradigm for engineering education (2000) Environmental challenges, pp. 505-515. , Springer Amesterdam; Bogaschewsky, R., (1995) Natürliche Umwelt und Produktion, , Gabler-Verlag Wiesbaden; Bonney, M., Jaber, M.Y., Environmentally responsible inventory models: Non-classical models for a non-classical era' (2011) International Journal of Production Economics, 133, pp. 43-53; Bostel, N., Dejax, P., Lu, Z., The design, planning, and optimization of reverse logistics networks (2005) Logistics systems: Design and optimization, pp. 171-212. , Springer New York; Bozorgi, A., Pazour, J., Nazzal, D., A new inventory model for cold items that considers costs and emissions (2014) International Journal of Production Economics, 155, pp. 114-125; Boustani, A., Sahni, S., Gutowski, T., Graves, S., (2010) Tire remanufacturing and energy savings, , Environmentally Benign Manufacturing Laboratory, Sloan School of Management, MITEI-1-h-2010, MIT Energy Initiative Report Series, MIT Cambridge; De Brito, M.P., Dekker, R., A framework for reverse logistics (2004) Reverse logistics, pp. 3-27. , Springer Berlin; Devoldere, T., Dewulf, W., Deprez, W., Willems, B., Duflou, J.R., Improvement potential for energy consumption in discrete part production machines (2007) Advances in life cycle engineering for sustainable manufacturing businesses, pp. 311-316. , Springer London; Dietmair, A., Verl, A., A generic energy consumption model for decision making and energy efficiency optimisation in manufacturing (2009) International Journal of Sustainable Engineering, 2, pp. 123-133; Dobos, I., Richter, K., A production/recycling model with stationary demand and return rates (2003) Central European Journal of Operations Research, 11, pp. 35-46; Dobos, I., Richter, K., An extended production/recycling model with stationary demand and return rates (2004) International Journal of Production Economics, 90 (3), pp. 311-323; Dowlatshahi, S., Developing a theory of reverse logistics (2000) Interfaces, 30, pp. 143-155; El Saadany, A.M.A., Jaber, M.Y., The EOQ repair and waste disposal model with switching costs (2008) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 55, pp. 219-233; El Saadany, A.M.A., Jaber, M.Y., A production/remanufacturing inventory model with price and quality dependent return rate (2010) Computers & Industrial Engineering, 58, pp. 352-362; El Saadany, A.M.A., Jaber, M.Y., A production/remanufacture model with returns' subassemblies managed differently (2011) International Journal of Production Economics, 133, pp. 119-126; El Saadany, A.M.A., Jaber, M.Y., Bonney, M., Environmental performance measures for supply chains (2011) Management Research Review, 34, pp. 1202-1221; El Saadany, A.M.A., Jaber, M.Y., Bonney, M., How many times to remanufacture?

However, recent research suggests that higher urban density is associated with higher emissions from long-distance leisure travel, such as car weekend trips and international flights. This article presents the first systematic review of empirical evidence on these associations and discusses potential explanations. A two-step article selection process yielded 27 empirical articles, complemented by one article published during the review process. When international travel is included in the analysis, the results suggest that residents of the largest cities, and particularly those from centrally located and densely built areas, travel more to cover long distances than do others, after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic variables. When only domestic travel is included, residents of larger settlements and areas of higher density engage in less long-distance travel for leisure purposes than those living in smaller settlements and sparsely built areas. The results of the review are indicative and warrant more research. Generalization is currently limited because of the wide variety of travel behavior measures used, consideration of different travel modes and trip purposes, and geographic scope. There is a strong need for replication of the results using consistent methodology, using data from longer and more recent time spans, and expanding to more diverse geographical settings, especially outside Europe. The systematic review is followed by a narrative review of theoretical explanations of the associations. The most common explanations include: rebound effects, the compensation hypothesis, access to transport infrastructure, urban lifestyles, sociopsychological characteristics, and social networks. Socioeconomic variables are controlled in a majority of the reviewed studies, and business travel is excluded from the review, so the concentration of wealth and business in cities may explain the findings only to some extent. Nonetheless, there is not enough empirical evidence on the causal character of the associations and therefore further qualitative and multidisciplinary work is needed. Compact city and urban densification policies are not strongly challenged by current evidence, and most common policy recommendations point to including air travel into carbon taxing or quota schemes. © 2018 The Author(s).","Carbon footprint; Greenhouse gas emissions; Long-distance travel; Travel behavior; Urban density; Urban form","Aamaas, B., Peters, G.P., The climate impact of Norwegians' travel behavior Travel Behav (2017) Soc., 6, pp. 10-18; Aamaas, B., Borken-Kleefeld, J., Peters, G.P., The climate impact of travel behavior: A German case study with illustrative mitigation options (2013) Environ.

Europe has taken the leadership in environmental regulations by introducing the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU-ETS) in 2005 and by promoting a set of policies destined to lower carbon emissions from energy, industrial, and transport sectors. These environmental policies have significantly affected the production choices of these European sectors. Considering this framework, the objective of this paper is to evaluate the effects of the application of environmental policies in a multitiered closed-loop supply chain network where raw material suppliers, manufacturers, consumers, and recovery centers operate. In particular, we assume that manufacturers are subject to the EU-ETS and a carbon tax is imposed on truck transport. In this way, the developed model captures carbon emission regulations, recycling, transportation and technological factors within a unified framework. In particular, it allows for evaluating the impacts of the considered environmental regulations on carbon emissions, product flows, and prices. The proposed model is optimized and solved by using the theory of variational inequalities. Our analysis shows that the combined application of the EU-ETS at the manufacturers’ tier and the carbon tax on truck transport implies additional costs for producers that reduce their good provisions. On the other side, this has a positive outcome for the environment since CO2 emissions reduce. Moreover, an increase of the efficiency level of the recycling process increments the availability of reusable raw material in the reverse supply chain. Finally, the distance between a couple of CLSC tiers plays a very important role. The lower is the distance covered by vehicles, the higher is the production of goods and the lower is the amount of CO2 emitted. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2017.","Closed-loop supply chain network; Environmental regulations; Variational inequality approach","Barbagallo, A., Daniele, P., Giuffrè, S., Maugeri, A., Variational approach for a general financial equilibrium problem: The Deficit formula, the balance law and the liability formula a path to the economy recovery (2014) European Journal of Operational Research, 237 (1), pp. 231-244; Brandenburg, M., Rebs, T., Sustainable supply chain management: A modeling perspective (2015) Annals of Operations Research, 229 (1), pp. 213-252; Daniele, P., Maugeri, A., Oettli, W., Time-dependent traffic equilibria (1999) Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 103, pp. 543-555; Dhanda, K.K., Nagurney, A., Ramanujam, P., (1999) Environmental Networks. a Framework for Economic Decision-Making and Policy Analysis, , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publisher; (2006) EU-ETS Review, , http://ec.europa.eu/clima/policies/ets/docs/report_int_competitiveness_20061222_en.pdf, Report on international competitiveness; Elhedhli, S., Merrick, R., Green supply chain network design to reduce carbon emissions (2012) Transportation Research Part D, 17, pp. 370-379; Facchinei, F., Pang, J.-S., Finite-dimensional variational inequalities and complementarity problems (2003) Berlin: Springer.

The allocation of ETS revenue from auctioning carbon emission allowance is important for the achievement of China’s joint targets of economic growth, mitigation, and welfare improvement. This study develops a dynamic CGE model to evaluate the effects of different ETS revenue allocation mechanisms and identifies the proper mechanism for China’s ETS design. Ten scenarios including business as usual (BAU), no ETS revenue allocation incentive (NA) and other eight ETS revenue allocation scenarios are designed. Simulation results indicate that the tradeoff between economic cost and environmental benefit exists under different ETS revenue allocation mechanisms. ETS revenue is suggested to allocate to household sector through reducing indirect tax and, after 2020, a certain proportion of ETS revenue could be allocated to production sector for improving energy-saving technology (i.e., STP mechanism). This study provides references for policymakers in China to design effective and realistic ETS-related policies. A similar study could be conducted to explore the proper ETS and the revenue allocation policies in other countries that have similar national conditions to China, such as other BRICS countries. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CGE model; China; CO2 emissions; ETS; Revenue allocation","Abdi, A., Taghipour, S., Forecasting carbon price in the Western Climate Initiative market using Bayesian networks (2019) Carbon Management, 2019; Bao, Q., Tang, L., Zhang, Z.X., Wang, S., Impacts of border carbon adjustments on China's sectoral emissions: Simulations with a dynamic computable general equilibrium model (2013) China Economic Review, 24, pp. 77-94; Boden, T.A., Marland, G., Andres, R.J., (2016) Global, Regional, and National Fossil-Fuel CO 2 Emissions; Brink, C., Vollebergh, H., Werf, E., Carbon pricing in the EU: evaluation of different EU ETS reform options (2016) Energy Policy, 97, pp. 603-617; Cao, J., Ho, M.S., Jorgenson, D.W., Nielsen, C.P., China’s emissions trading system and an ETS-carbon tax hybrid (2019) Energy Econ, 236 (15), pp. 172-182; Capstick, S.B., Lewis, A., Effects of personal carbon emission allowances on decision-making: evidence from an experimental simulation (2010) Clim Pol, 10 (4), pp. 369-384; Chang, K., Ge, F., Zhang, C., Wang, W., The dynamic linkage effect between energy and emissions allowances price for regional emissions trading scheme pilots in China (2018) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 98, pp. 415-425; Cheng, B., Dai, H., Wang, P., Zhao, D., Masui, T., Impacts of carbon trading scheme on air pollutant emissions in Guangdong Province of China (2015) Energy for Sustainable Development, 27, pp. 174-185. , COI: 1:CAS:528:DC%2BC2MXhtVOht77O; (2015) China Emission Accounts and Datasets (Ceads), , http://www.ceads.net/; (2012) Input–output Table, , http://www.stats.gov.cn/ztjc/tjzdgg/trccxh/zlxz/trccb/201701/t20170113_1453448.html; Choi, Y., Liu, Y., Lee, H., The economy impacts of Korean ETS with an emphasis on sectoral coverage based on a CGE approach (2017) Energy Policy, 109, pp. 835-844; Dai, H., Masui, T., Matsuoka, Y., Fujimori, S., Assessment of China’s climate commitment and non-fossil energy plan towards 2020 using hybrid AIM/CGE model (2011) Energy Policy, 39 (5), pp. 2875-2887; Dai, H., Xie, X., Xie, Y., Liu, J., Masui, T., Green growth: the economic impacts of large-scale renewable energy development in China (2016) Appl Energy, 162, pp. 435-449; Dai, H., Xie, Y., Liu, J., Masui, T., Aligning renewable energy targets with carbon emissions trading to achieve China’s INDCs: a general equilibrium assessment (2018) Renew Sust Energ Rev, 82, pp. 4121-4131; Fan, Y., Wu, J., Xia, Y., Liu, J.Y., How will a nationwide carbon market affect regional economies and efficiency of CO2 emission reduction in China?

Socio-psychological surveys provide additional insights into consumption behaviour reflecting important lifestyle, attitudinal, risk, familiarity of technology, cultural and other forms of demographic preferences. There is a need for an evidence based tool that can forecast the effectiveness of intervention options for commercial buildings whilst removing the confounding effects of business-as-usual strategies. This paper describes a framework for evaluating the uptake of building retrofits under various government policy and behaviour program interventions aimed at reducing carbon emissions. The framework incorporates socio-psychological factors into an agent based model, applying diffusion and discrete choice modeling in evaluating the effectiveness of intervention programs, especially those involving direct subsidies (e.g. rebate to upfront costs, tax deductions) to facilitate the uptake of low carbon living practices. This framework is implemented in the ZEO Uptake Analysis Tool which allows planners, researchers and policy makers to assess the relative impact of assumptions about future technology and policy using a defined baseline (or “business as usual” scenario) for comparison. The Tool uses agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) to encapsulate the attributes and behaviour of various elements and entities in the building retrofit problem. The paper presents preliminary results from application of the agent-based model to the State of Victoria building stock, in a case study to understand the potential of the Energy Efficient Office Buildings Program in the uptake of energy efficient retrofits. The analysis indicates that the proposed policy options offered by EEOB have very little impact when we consider small building owners and limit the application to building tuning only. There is improvement in uptake when we expand the eligibility to all technologies (excluding lighting) and this is dominated by HVAC (Chiller) upgrades. © 2020 Proceedings - 21st International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2015.
